erx_broken_arrow.1.d: "He stood there, seconds away from execution by those he once considered his brothers in arms. He felt something he had never felt before. Rage. Not petty and fleeting but rage that radiated through his soul. Anger at the men standing before him, anger at Dr. Anderson, and at the state of America. But mostly anger at himself, for he knew with his death he had failed both himself and his country. So when seconds later his thoughts were interrupted by an unexpected blinding flash and an explosion that left his ears ringing, the last thing he expected as his vision hazily began to return was several men rushing into the room and gunning down the men who were mere moments ago about to execute him. One of the men started unshackling his handcuffs and it was then that he noticed that he knew the man. As he was about to ask what he was doing here the man interrupted him and said 'Mr President! There's no time, we have to go now! Take this and stay down!' As he was handed the officer’s M1911 he heard sirens beginning to blare and chaos erupting around him. As they left the room he was held in he saw that hundreds of men,women and children who he knew to be his supporters stood outside waiting for his instructions."

erx_broken_arrow.2.d: "But before he could say anything, some of the men pushed through the crowd carrying to his shock Sergeant Arch Dornan. A man whom he had considered a great personal friend. Prior to his betrayal via support for Anderson in the election that is. With chaos all around there wasn't much time and Granite had to choose what to do with Dornan."

erx_broken_arrow.3.t: "Final Escape"
erx_broken_arrow.3.d: "After dealing with Dornan, Granite began evacuating the group into a secret stash of hidden Vertibirds, stowed away out of the eyes of the purists. But as he boarded the final aircraft he was left with a choice. Should he leave as quickly and quietly as possible? Ensuring the safety of his men and their families, but robbing them of their vengeance?\n\nBut as he looked into the eyes of the men, women and children boarding the Vertibirds, he saw the fear, the anger, the confusion. That rage boiled back up into the surface. But they had little time before Anderson could muster a reaction force, so his choice must be made now."

erx_broken_arrow.4.d: "Despite all that we do to restore our great nation, we are betrayed. We escaped just barely with all we could carry, to our fortune, our new home is quite familiar to our older members. But nevertheless, our thankfulness at the escape of our Army and so many men, whose loved ones have passed through an agonizing week, must not blind us to the fact that what has happened in Nevada and California is a colossal national disaster. Our cause has been weakened, some say it has been lost, all of those fortified lines and facilities in the Sierra Army Depot upon which so much faith had been reposed is gone, with all the tragic consequences that follow from that, and we must expect another blow to be struck almost immediately at us or at those who could not escape. But for now we must tend to our dead, and to our wounded. But make no mistake, we will not give up, we will fight again men, next time to victory, when the time is right."

Their goons have also begun to arrest or simply execute local officials and protesters. In defiance of our attempts to seize power by peaceful and Democratic means they will have none of it.

I, yourselves, and most of everyone within this government, call: The Reformers. But we didn't begin that way. We had been indoctrinated through Richardson, through a false ideology, over a begotten idea of America that should have never come to exist. It unfortunately still does, within the Purists to the east, and perhaps many more locations we don't know about.'\n\n'We shall see to it that they are crushed, but only metaphorically. We should strive to be better men than they, even if it means sparing them when they would just as quickly murder us all... That being said, that brings me to the topics of the Brotherhood and New California Republic. Some of you are deeply familiar with them. Others of you may have only heard passing mentions, without care for the workings of government or the Brotherhood. I seek to unite both of us. In the past, the Brotherhood and NCR fought the Enclave. We are not them, not anymore. We are something better.'\n\n'But in spite of all this, the Enclave has committed many, many, many atrocities. Some that even the most intellectually stunted or gifted person would instantly shoot me in the head for. We must not let any of this information see the light of day. It shall be disbursed over months, years, decades. I do not believe it is the most entirely right or moral thing to do, but the Reformers are about compromise. This is one of them.'\n\n'Should it be known that any of the information the following presentation is about to show you about the full scope of the Enclave, its history, its membership... its crimes, be leaked or revealed to the public, the capital punishment is that you shall be taken here to the Capitol Building, and undergo a secret trial. The Pre-War America rarely, if ever, engaged in such secret courts and trials, insisting that all of it be made public. But know that if any of you reveal it, you will be disgraced, you will be disbarred, you will be branded as a liar and traitor. And you will not see the outside world ever again, placed in a solitary confinement cell until the next century begins, if even that.'\n\n'Am I understood, gentlemen?'\n\nS.F"

erx_broken_arrow.16.t: "The Yankee Doodle Boy"
erx_broken_arrow.16.d: "It used to be that sitting with your family, listening to the radio was an American pastime, much like baseball or voting. Douglas himself remembered his father talking about how he used to stand around listening to the radio blare over the speakers of his post on the Rig. How surprised he was when he came to the mainland, expecting nothing but silence and memories of the songs to fill his remaining days, only to one day fiddle with his helmet's headset and begin to hear a familiar tune, not from the Rig, but from Pre-War broadcasts and even New California Republic stations.\n\nGeneral broadcasts were also something that he fondly, yet sadly, remembered as he recalled his father's last days, not resting in bed as he should have, surrounded by loving family, but instead serving on yet another mercenary mission that he had been forced to come along to. Canadian and Mexican radio, what little there was, certainly was interesting when he could understand their foreign tongues, but most of the time, he was concerned with his father, who had been slipping more and more into senility with each passing day. Mentats had helped for so long, but even they were beginning to falter.\n\nOne day, close to the day the Sergeant finally passed, the tune of 'Yankee Doodle' began to play on loop. Many of the Enclave Control Company members quickly tired of it, but the Sergeant surprisingly became lucid whenever the song was played, despite him mumbling and even bumbling the lyrics at points. It was at one of these moments that he took his son under his wing, pulling him out of earshot and view of any prying eyes, and disclosed something he hoped his son would never forget.\n\nS.F"

erx_broken_arrow.17.t: "I Vow to Thee My Country"
erx_broken_arrow.17.d: "For much of the wasteland, the idea of cross country communication was either a fool's dream, or something only accomplished by a scant few, from the Canadians who trekked to California for some reason or other, to those who crossed from the West Coast to the East Coast. But for President Granite, it was a reality he heard each and every day, whether he was reading the latest Crimson Caravan letter (at an outrageous $200 NCR price tag), or listening to Mexican broadcasts from across the Old World border.\n\nBut today, motivated by his musings of his father, Douglas journeyed to where a small group of radio techies had surmounted themselves at the Pre-War KPDJ station. Once decrepit and inhabited by Mirelurk spawn, the station now blared with life... if one could call static, sparks, and smoke 'life'. He had been assured that things would go over smoothly with the first ever broadcast since they had lost the transmitter at the SAD, however.\n\nHiram Dirk Girflux, HDG for short, donned his 'disc jockey' headset, styled in a fashion he claimed he had seen on a mutant once, and switched all broadcasting equipment on.\n\n'Aetherwaves are loud and clear for you to speak, Prez!'\n\nDouglas gave a small cough, with the reverb throughout the station confirming the transmission was active. Taking out a small holodisk from his breast pocket, the President gave a short soliloquy on how, while this was not a wholly American song, it was something that he hoped could be the first of many uplifting broadcasts to come.\n\n'I vow to thee, my country, all earthly things above, the service of my love...'"

Now we finally have the opportunity to get our vengeance. We have now surrounded arroyo, inch by inch, state by state. Their allies are gone, as is hope for their survival.

According to our records before the Great War, the Army Corps of Engineers was tasked with fortifying the West Coast against possible invasion via several major hubs, one of these was Woodley Island Military Base alongside the nearby Tuluwat Island, isolated from the city by sea, well defended, seems like the perfect base of operations.

We regardless are preparing to take the island base,  we can either storm the bridge using our power Armour as a vanguard whilst our vertibird assault the island compound from above, or as our more … nimble men suggest, we can deploy some men in under the cover of night, infiltrate the facility and gut the raiders in their sleep. A Frontal Assault leaves us at the mercy of whatever pre war technology they have managed to uncover from the base, not to mention the full force of their firepower. whilst a surgical strike under the cover of night could result in our men being captured and no doubt executed.

erx_broken_arrow.100.t: "An Election Despoiled"
erx_broken_arrow.100.d: "The hopes of a 'Free and Fair Election' were quickly ruined by the reality of just how divided the Sierra Army Depot was. The divisions between the Purists and the Reformers seemed to sneak its way into every facet of what could be called the society of the Depot.\n\nIt seemed that every man, woman, and child had an opinion regarding the various differences between the two factions. He saw it in the Cafeteria, the dual radios both run by either Purists or Reformer sympathizers and more importantly, he saw it in the corruption that seeped through the halls. The Depot was rotten to the core and the upcoming election just highlighted every little problem and ugly lie that was hiding beneath every shadowy crevice. \n\nGranite, in an attempt of good faith, kept himself out of the riffraff of paying off voters and other such…. arrangements, despite claims to the contrary by his critic, but he was no fool, Anderson wouldn't do the same. So it was of little surprise when a deal gone wrong between a purist hardliner, and a Reformer recruit regarding the upcoming election ended up in a bloody firefight that left several men dead. \n\nTo make matters worse this 'minor' incident uncovered a massive purist scandal to steal the election from us. Granite expected it to be sure, but this wasn't some planned act of voter fraud or some two-bit attempt at making a play for the election. There were plans to completely sideline him, no matter what the majority wanted...and even dispose of him, was this was Anderson thought Democracy meant?"

'In my hand, I have proof that Granite attempted to go behind our backs, and tamper with Democracy itself! The people's will was almost his own' \n\nGranite stared at the Doctor with anger and confusion brewing in his face, he dared? 'I would ne-!'', He begins to shout before a dozen enclave troopers storm in.  \n\n'Gentlemen, take this traitor away! He claims to respect democracy, but he himself admits it and looks how his face grows red with anger that we caught him in the act,'' Smiling Anderson stalked near, ever mindful of the guards between him and Granite, he knew which one, between the two of them, was a former mercenary captain after all. 'In fact, arrest all of his supporters, we don't know how far this corruption goes, and I will not allow the Enclave to be infected by these reformers, clearly their time with the mutants has tainted them, rigging an election, admitting to it, or attempting to say I, a man who knew President Richardson himself, would dare tamper with what made America so great?'' \n\nLaughing Anderson stepped away as the enclave troopers grabbed a hold of Granite, who let them grab him, something told him the 'Good' Doctor would not harshly reprimand the soldiers if his resistance led to Granite's early death. Staring at Anderson's retreating back, he wondered whether he ever truly knew how deep the corruption in the Enclave truly ran…"

These are the foundations of which the republic has built its empire. They parody truth, but Truth built on fallacies are no truth at all. They are nothing but elaborate ruses. Houses of cards meant to imitate sincerity. But in reality they do not offer closure or truth. But only empty and hollow promises. They may build a strong house.

erx_broken_arrow_fireside.3.t: "Spectre"
erx_broken_arrow_fireside.3.d: "My friends:\nThis is not a fireside chat on war. It is a talk on national security; Tonight, in the presence of a world crisis, my mind goes back to our founding fathers, to those who came before, Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln. And I ask myself, just what would they do? It is a question that results in many sleepless nights. However I know the thought on your minds tonight and every night, is what I will do, or more frankly, what we will do as a nation, to address the current crisis we find ourselves in. With war on the horizon and so much chaos in the world, who could blame you? Because isn't the whole purpose of your President to keep you now, and your children later, and your grandchildren much later, out of a last-ditch war for the preservation of American independence? Even  as I speak to you now this fear strikes terror into your hearts. It controls all thought and all actions. It dictates to you, when you should to it. If you hear one thing I say tonight then hear this. If we are united, in thought and spirit. If we stand together shoulder to shoulder. Then we need not fear nothing else. For the only thing we truly have to fear, is fear itself. But I did not come here tonight just to give vague promises and guarantees. I come to make the reality of our situation absolutely and unequivocally clear.\n\nEven during the great war of 2077, we knew that our country would survive, it would be battered, and beaten. But it would stand eventually. But this new threat that faces us? These maniacs in New Reno and elsewhere? This is no threat of war, this is an existential threat to our very existence and indeed the existence of the human race as we know it.  Not since Jamestown and Plymouth Rock has our American civilization been in such danger as it is in this very moment. For on [GetDateText] this year by an agreement signed in New Reno, three powerful despots, two in the west and one in the east(North if MacArthur Betray),  have thenceforth joined themselves together in the most unholy of alliances. The Tyrants of Nevada, The Scourge of Seattle, and most threateningly the enigmatic 'Chicago Enclave'.\nThis Axis of Evil have made it clear that they intend not only to dominate all life and thought in their own countries, but also to enslave the whole of America, and then to use the resources of America to dominate and conquer the rest of the world. In view of the nature of this undeniable threat, it can be asserted, properly and categorically, that the United States has no right or reason to encourage talk of peace until the day shall come when there is a clear intention on the part of these aggressor nations to abandon all thought of dominating or conquering the world.\n\nTo this point you know im sure that some nations of this continent were bound by solemn nonintervention pacts with the various powers posed against us. Other nations were assured by them that they need never fear invasion. Nonintervention pact or not, the fact remains that they were attacked, overrun, thrown into modern slavery at an hour's notice - or even without any notice at all. As an exiled leader of one of these nations said to me the other day, 'The notice was a minus quantity. It was given to my government two hours after their troops had poured into my country in a hundred places.' The fate of these nations tells us what it means to live at the point of a tyrants gun.\n\nThe collective tyrants have justified such actions by various pious frauds. One of these frauds is the claim that they are occupying a nation for the purpose of 'restoring order and racial purity.' Another is that they are occupying or controlling a nation on the excuse that they are 'protecting it' against the aggression of somebody else. For example, The Washington Brotherhood has said that she was occupying Bellingham to save them from the Canadians. Would she then hesitate to say to any American country: 'We are occupying you to protect you from aggression by the United States?' Bellingham today is being used as an invasion base against Canada, now fighting for its life. And any North American country, in tyrant hands, would always constitute a jumping off place for attack on any one of the other republics of this hemisphere.\n\nThe experience of the past several years has proven beyond doubt that no nation can appease these tyrants. No man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it. There can be no appeasement with ruthlessness. There can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb. We know now that a nation can have peace with the tyrants only at the price of total surrender. And even then subjected to the worse kind of abuses imaginable.\n\nThe history of recent years proves that the shootings and the chains and the concentration camps are not simply the transient tools but the very altars of modern dictatorships. They may talk of a 'new order' in the world, but what they have in mind is only a revival of the oldest and the worst tyranny. In that there is no liberty, no religion, no hope. The proposed 'new order' is the very opposite of what this country stands for. It is not a government based upon the consent of the governed. It is not a union of ordinary, self-respecting men and women to protect themselves and their freedom and their dignity from oppression. It is an unholy alliance of power and pelf to dominate and to enslave the human race.\n\n'Dark Days Lie Ahead'."

erx_broken_arrow_fireside.4.t: "Arsenal of Democracy"
erx_broken_arrow_fireside.4.d: "Recently, I talked with you about what has come to be known as the 'Axis of Evil' while the purpose of that talk was to inform you of the exact nature of our enemies. I think it pertinant to explain, as your president, just what we are going to, and actively doing about it.\n\nAt this very moment the forces of the States that are leagued against all peoples who live in freedom are being held away from our shores. Reno and Seattle are being blocked in mortal combat by the New California Republic, and soon by our forces. In land air and sea, and by thousands of soldiers and sailors who were able to escape from subjugated countries. In the East the Chicago Enclave are being engaged by the Freedom loving peoples of that region, in another great defense. In the Pacific Ocean is our fleet. Armed with lethal weaponry, both economic and military. However even as this momentous war rages around us there are those who say that the Axis powers would never dare have any desire to attack our nation. That is the same dangerous form of wishful thinking which has destroyed the powers of resistance of so many conquered peoples. The plain facts are that the tyrants have proclaimed, time and again, that all other races are their inferiors and therefore subject to their orders. And most important of all, the vast resources and wealth of this American hemisphere constitute the most tempting loot in all of the round world.\n\nThey have therefore committed themselves directly and absolutely to war. The Californian people and their allies today are conducting this  war against this unholy alliance. Our own future security is greatly dependent on the outcome of that fight. The people of America who are defending themselves do not ask us to do their fighting, although fight we will. They ask us for the implements of war, the planes, the tanks, the guns, the freighters which will enable them to fight for their liberty and for our security. Emphatically, we must get these weapons to them, get them to them in sufficient volume and quickly enough so that we and our children will be saved the agony and suffering of war which others have had to endure. Democracy's fight against world conquest is being greatly aided, and must be more greatly aided, by the rearmament of the United States and by sending every ounce and every ton of munitions and supplies that we can possibly spare to help the defenders who are in the front lines. We are planning our own defense with the utmost urgency, and in its vast scale we must integrate the war needs of California and the other free nations which are resisting aggression. This is not a matter of sentiment or of controversial personal opinion. It is a matter of realistic, practical military policy, based on the advice of our military experts who are in close touch with existing warfare. These military and naval experts and the members of the Congress and the Administration have a single-minded purpose: the defense of the United States. This nation is making a great effort to produce everything that is necessary in this emergency, and with all possible speed. And this great effort requires great sacrifice. I would ask no one to defend a democracy which in turn would not defend every one in the nation against want and privation. The strength of this nation shall not be diluted by the failure of the government to protect the economic well-being of its citizens. If our capacity to produce is limited by machines, it must ever be remembered that these machines are operated by the skill and the stamina of the workers. Nine days ago I announced the setting up of a more effective organization to direct our gigantic efforts to increase the production of munitions. American industrial genius, unmatched throughout all the world in the solution of production problems, has been called upon to bring its resources and its talents into action. But all of our present efforts are not enough. We must have more ships, more guns, more planes -- more of everything. And this can be accomplished only if we discard the notion of "business as usual." This job cannot be done merely by superimposing on the existing productive facilities the added requirements of the nation for defense. Our defense efforts must not be blocked by those who fear the future consequences of surplus plant capacity. The possible consequences of failure of our defense efforts now are much more to be feared. And after the present needs of our defense are past, a proper handling of the country's peacetime needs will require all of the new productive capacity, if not still more. No pessimistic policy about the future of America shall delay the immediate expansion of those industries essential to defense. We need them. I want to make it clear that it is the purpose of the nation to build now with all possible speed every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufacture our defense material. We have the men, the skill, the wealth, and above all, the will. I am confident that if and when production of consumer or luxury goods in certain industries requires the use of machines and raw materials that are essential for defense purposes, then such production must yield, and will gladly yield, to our primary and compelling purpose. So I appeal to the owners of plants, to the managers, to the workers, to our own government employees to put every ounce of effort into producing these munitions swiftly and without stint. With this appeal I give you the pledge that all of us who are officers of your government will devote ourselves to the same whole-hearted extent to the great task that lies ahead. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war. "We must be the great arsenal of democracy.""

And we cannot blind ourselves any longer to the undeniable fact that the evil forces which have crushed and undermined and corrupted so many others are already within our own gates. Your government knows much about them and every day is ferreting them out. Their secret emissaries, agents of the devil himself are active in our own and in neighboring countries. They seek to stir up suspicion and dissension, to cause internal strife. They try to turn capital against labor, and vice versa. They try to reawaken long slumbering racial and religious enmities which should have no place in this country. They are active in every group that promotes intolerance or hatred. They exploit for their own ends our own natural  abhorrence of war. These trouble-breeders have but one purpose. It is to divide our people, to divide them into hostile groups and to destroy our unity and shatter our will to defend ourselves.\nThere are also American citizens, many of them in high places, who, unwittingly in most cases, are aiding and abetting the work of these agents. I do not charge these American citizens with being foreign agents. But I do charge them with doing exactly the kind of work that the dictators want done in the United States. These people not only believe that we can save our own skins by shutting our eyes to the fate of other nations. Some of them go much further than that. They say that we can and should become the friends and even the partners of these despots, Some of them even suggest that we should imitate the methods of the dictatorships.

By supplying the Garrison with the equipment it needs and the provisional city government with the funds they require we can simultaneously crush the rampant criminal gangs in the city and fund several infrastructure and repair operations in the city.\n\nSetting the stage for the future."

erx_broken_arrow_development_oregon_eugene_desc:0 "While certainly not a major achievement the capture of the city of Eugene from the Crab Cultists is something to be proud of. Though looking at the state of the city we almost wished we hadn't. More then half the city is at least partially flooded as a deliberate action by the cultists to better worship their 'God' with blocked sewers and drainage pipes to purposely destroyed water maintenance systems. The half that isn't flooded is torn to shreds and covered top to bottom in 'Human Sacrifices' and Overgrown vegetation. We certainly have our hands full on this one. However if we can drain the city and repair the pumps  there is hope for the city yet.\n\nGotta start somewhere I guess."

erx_broken_arrow_mariposa.1.d: "PRESIDENT'S EYES ONLY\n\nCaptain Church Reporting:\n\nMr. President,\nThe second excavation has gone according to schedule. Any FEV present in both the air and soil samples we've taken indicate that about 40 years of being left relatively untouched (save a presence of mutagen on the 4th level) has left the virus vastly weakened compared to its gradual effectiveness the last time we were around here. Luckily, just like last time, our Power Armor and environmental suits filter out the virus. Since we also refrain from outside 'help', unlike the last time, we were able to guarantee no outside infiltration, and drove off nosy wastelanders through simple commands and a disarming a nuclear device cover story.\n\nI'm sure you're getting sick of me bringing up the past, but I have already taken the liberty rigging the entrance to the base to collapse as soon as the pure sample of FEV you requested was obtained. As a small side note, it appeared that by the time we arrived, contrary to the reports of one Col. Sanders, a collapse or perhaps explosion caused by unknown means allowed reentry into the base. Although it doesn't appear much was disturbed, save the corpses of the mutant miners, it gives cause for concern that perhaps someone else out there has a sample or mutation of FEV.\n\nThe real threat, however, was our discovery of a pipeline on the 5th level, unknown to the previous Enclave. When investigated, we found it led to the Pre-War location known as 'Crater Lake' in Oregon. Upon arriving, we discovered almost the entire lake had been filled with FEV. How or why such an event occurred may never be known to us, but we do know it allegedly served as the source of the 'Troll Warren' Super Mutant group we had encountered a while back. Unlike Mariposa, we do not believe this requires careful investigation, as much of the samples have been contaminated with all sorts of organic material and corrupted deceased lifeforms fused over and over within the lake.\n\nS.F"

erx_broken_arrow_mariposa.2.d: "Property Of The Department Of Defense\nAuthorized Personnel Only\nSierra Army Depot\nAddendum: The Discovery of new reports from the data banks in Sierra now indicate that the Enclave was aware of and monitoring Federal Forces much earlier then originally anticipated. The implications of this discovery for the moment are unclear. This matter should be investigated further.\n\nCommunique: Request For Orders Regarding Mariposa\nEnclave Purification Company, Monroe Division\n\nMr. President,\n\nThe interloper known as Granite has blundered his way back to the site of one of the previous administration's greatest failures. We of course are referring to Mariposa Military Base. An addendum of the base's history has been briefed to you in anticipation of reading our report, but it appears that things are worse than we thought.\n\nThankfully, due to their vacating of the Sierra Army Depot, the upstart has been forced to go without the security of encryption, which our superior Enclave technology has broken with ease. Although we can only garner basic communications, it does not appear Granite is making any major moves or attempts to compromise our operations. And appears to be completely unaware of our presence.\n\nThe EPC has reported a presence of one known former division, under the command of one Private-turned-'Captain' Church. Why Granite promoted them despite their constant failures is beyond any of us. Commander Dinos performed recon around Mariposa, and aside from a few mutie habitats, the so-called 'Federals' have only made out with a single sample of the FEV Virus.\nAlthough orders were not to engage, our division took the liberty of eradicating the mutie habitats under the cover of night and using a failed FEV 'cure' to liquify internal organs and bone structures of the mutants, making it appear that they had simply undergone spontaneous mutation due to the proximity of their rock houses near Mariposa.\n\nAt this time, it does not appear that Granite's forces, what little we could make out, have equivalent equipment to us in the slightest. We even watched as one of the would-be soldiers fiddled with their weapon, almost shooting their eye out with it.\n\nAll of this is to say, President Anderson, is that right now, the potential threat Granite poses to us is...\n\nS.F"

erx_broken_arrow_mariposa.3.d: "President Anderson:\n\nDr. Ortiz of the Chemical Corps here. I'm glad the CC talked you out of simply nuking the base and being done with it. Even the most disgusting and impure mutants can still offer much in the way of scientific pursuits, at least more than what little we know of Chicago's scientific exploits. To be brief:\n\n1. FEV Extraction team entered at approximately 0500 hours, armed with all forms of pyroclastic and incendiary weapons and repellent tools.\n2. Team eliminated a small inhabited settlement housing close to 300 mutant beings on their way to enter the base, base itself almost completely uninhabited.\n3. Team secured pure FEV sample from mutagen container housed on 5th floor. Armor enhancements ensured no FEV toxins entered their armor or bodies.\n4. FEV sample successfully extracted by the Extraction team, sent to President Anderson.\n\nNow, I wanted to let you do the honors, so attached in this document is a remote detonator, modified to be triggered from up to 1000 miles away. It should be more than enough distance to let you see our newest handiwork. Now go ahead and press the button.\n\nPressed it? Good. If you didn't, press it now.\n\nAssuming you've pressed it, you will now be witnessing the activation of our NOSOI satellite array. Although we are hundreds of miles from activation, much like the nuclear bombs of then and now, you'll witness a once-in-a-lifetime event happen.\n\nWhat you are seeing is the result of untold decades of the finest scientific and biological minds coming together to engineer a substance close to the dispersant of the original FEV-Curling 13, although with significant limitations.\n\nThat green cloud of gas isn't just an optical illusion, it's a veritable 'beam' of mutant killer. But don't be alarmed, the 'beam' only has a radius of 15 miles, and dissipates after approximately 5 miles further out. Even more unfortunately, this was the only usable supply of the material. Coming up with another batch won't take decades, but it will take some months, years even. But hey, if you haven't pressed the button, you have yourself a free satellite of mutant cleanser to aim anywhere in the world!\n\nS.F"
